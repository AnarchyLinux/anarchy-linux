# About

Anarchy Linux is an Arch Linux installer (**not a distro!**) providing a
hassle-free installation and polished user experience.
Every aspect of the install is taken into account from partitioning and
general system configuration, to installing your favorite DE/WM and additional
software from the official Arch Linux repos.

The Anarchy installer intends to provide both novice and experienced Linux
users a simple and pain free way to install Arch Linux.
Install when you want it, where you want it, and however you want it.
That is the Anarchy philosophy.
