On June 8, 2019 Anarchy Linux received its 1.0.4 release.

This release had the following changes:

* QT4 was removed from the package list
* MongoDB was removed from the optional software list
* A timeout was added to the syslinux config file
* `arch-wiki-cli` was removed from the package list

With the upcoming release of 1.0.5, which already has way more changes,
we can safely say this was a minor release,
but a release worth checking out nonetheless.
