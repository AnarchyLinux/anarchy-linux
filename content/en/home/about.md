Anarchy Linux is an Arch Linux installer distro,
which guides you through the whole installation,
including choosing a kernel, partitioning,
installing drivers, bootloaders and network utilities.
It even has [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) support by default using [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay).
