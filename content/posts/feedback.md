Hello,

My name is Erazem and I'm a fairly new contributor to the Anarchy Linux project and the author of this website.

Like (hopefully) most of you reading this, I really like the project and as a beginner
in open source I wanted to contribute to it.
Since I only know a bit about bash scripting I haven't been able to contribute much
actual code yet, but that didn't stop me from contributing altogether.
And it shouldn't stop you from contributing either.

If you know how to code in bash that's great - find [an issue](https://github.com/deadhead420/anarchy-linux/issues)
you like and help fix it, or even add a feature you'd like to see in Anarchy.

If you don't know how to code there's still a bunch of things to do - fix typos in the [README](https://github.com/deadhead420/anarchy-linux/blob/master/README.md),
update [the website](https://github.com/deadhead420/anarchy-linux/tree/website-source) or help translate the project.

If you can't see yourself doing any of those things, you can still help us in other ways:

Test the software and [report bugs](https://github.com/deadhead420/anarchy-linux/issues)

or

Give us feedback on the project:

* Tell us what you like/dislike about the new website design
* Tell us what new features you'd like to see in the Anarchy installer
* Tell us how we can help you contribute to the project (maybe you just need a mentor)

As you can see there really are a lot of things you can do to contribute to this project
and we would really appreciate it if you tried doing at least one of them.

Enjoy your experience with Anarchy Linux :)
