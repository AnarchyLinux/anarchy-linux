On June 8, 2019, Anarchy Linux received its [1.0.4 release](https://github.com/deadhead420/anarchy-linux/releases/tag/1.0.4), finally.
With the upcoming release of 1.0.5, which already has way more changes,
we can safely say this was a minor release,

### Changelog:

* QT4 was removed from the package list
* MongoDB was removed from the optional software list
* A timeout was added to the syslinux config file
* `arch-wiki-cli` was removed from the package list
